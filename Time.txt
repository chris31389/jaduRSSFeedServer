10 minutes - I broke my time down into quickly designing the layout for the website.

I then thought about the architecture.  I have been asked to do this in PHP so i need to have a client-server architecture.  I have been asked to do the parsing in PHP otherwise I would have tried to do it in JQuery or another JavaScript based library,  this would have benifited me because I would avoid downloading the RSS feed directly to the server.  This would mean I would have to open up various security doors to allow this functionality.  As i've been asked to do this in PHP i will have to open these doors and try to deal with them securely.

20 minutes - For the design then, I decided on spliting the application into two parts.  The first part is the server side programming which will:
	> store RSS feed links in DB or other state based storage.
	> parse RSS feed into HTML code

the second part to the application is the front page:
	> display information to user.
	> load stored rss links.
	> allow user to add a new RSS feed.
	> allow user to delete a new RSS feed
	> post request to server to retrieve HTML on rss link.

60 minutes - I went through trying to learn what PHP was, as i haven't used it for 5 years I needed a recap.  I discoved its a OOD language so I could transfer some skills I have from ASP.NET with C#.  

30 minutes - Further to this I then generated my environment, creating a virtual linux server with LAMP installed to it.  I then installed SAMBA so I could transfer files to and from my windows machine.

now I'm ready to start coding.

60 minutes - I needed to look into how to read RSS feeds using PHP, discovering the PHP5 function simplexml_load_file() and file_get_contents();

30 minutes - after some further research i've discovered this: http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ajax_rss_reader.asp  Its an Ajax based RSS feed reader in PHP which is similar to what I want to do.  I'm going to look into replicating this on my site.

20 minutes - Learnt how to debug PHP in browser
  ini_set('display_errors', 'On');
  echo var_dump(get_object_vars($xmlDoc));
  echo var_dump(get_class_methods($xmlDoc));

60 minutes - researching into effective database storage options.  Decided on SQLite http://zetcode.com/db/sqlitephp/
	Make sure apache2, libapache2-mod-php5, php5-sqlite are installed.


60 minutes - learning SQL lite and how to access it using PHP.
	$db = new SQLite3('../db/test.db');
