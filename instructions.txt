# Pre instuctions.  Please make sure you have NodeJS installed.  The following are instructions to install nodeJS using ubuntu. (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-an-ubuntu-14-04-server)
  1. run the install nodejs and npm command:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    sudo apt-get install npm
  2. We also require Grunt to deploy the application.  run this command to install the cli:
    npm install -g grunt-cli
  3. To make sure that we have our server and php packages installed we can run:
    sudo apt-get install apache2
    sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
    sudo apt-get install php5-sqlite

# Deployment Instructions 
  1. navigate to the directory that you have checked out the git project.
  2. run the following command to install the deployment packages:
    npm install
  3. run grunt to build our application:
    grunt 
  2. run the following command:
    sudo cp -Rup {server,client,index.php} /var/www/html

# Test RSS feeds:

# Further Notes:
  You may need to open up the apache2 server to allow the php script to access external rss links. We can change the php.ini file to set allow_url_fopen = 1 so we can allow file_get_contents($url) to work! (http://jaspreetchahal.org/workaround-simplexml_load_file-function-simplexml-load-file-http-wrapper-is-disabled-in-the-server-configuration-by-allow_url_fopen0/)

  The client directory is purely HTML, CSS and JavaScript,  we only need the apache server for the php scripts in the server folder.
